# hyCMD
hyCMD, also "HypixelUnknownCommand" is a plugin, that makes your chat's unknown command message look way better!
For newer versions like 1.21.4, there is no direct way to change your unknown chat message and you are stuck with
the usual boring <--[[HERE]] Unknown command message, which really just looks bad. Also if you are on lower versions
you still benefit from using this plugin, since you get the ('<cmdname>') at the end of the message like on hypixel,
giving extra style to your server!

### LICENSE
This project uses a **custom non-commercial license**. See [LICENSE](hyCMD/LICENSE) for details.

### MODIFY YOUR MESSAGE
There isn't any inbuilt configuration in this plugin, so you only have the hyCMD.jar file in your plugins folder,
no extra folders with configurations. If you still want to edit your message, you have to do so in the source
code.
